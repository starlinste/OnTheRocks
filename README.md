App for tracking tasting notes in different drinkables

The original concept is meant to be an application that allows people with Android devices to track their whiskey tasting notes on the nose, taste, experience, and more.

Plan also include adding an infinity/blend tracker and inventory tracker. 

This is just a super basic overview until I have something better to write here.
